# Processor-Project
A virtual processor with a unique instruction set made in C++.

# How it works
The program will read in a file containing 32 bit instructions and data.
The processor is specified an amount of virtual memory to use, 
and the instructions and data will be copied into memory. The processor
will execute instructions until the end execution instruction is recieved,
opcode 255. The processor includes 16 general purpose register with a program counter
and stack pointer. The program counter is initialized to the start of memory and the 
stack pointer to the end of the user's data. The program counter will be increamented
4 bytes (1 instruction) after every instruction execution, and can be editied directly
to create loops. The processor includes some special instructions for ease of use such 
as PRNR (print register value) and PRNM (print memory value).
